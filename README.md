# Hi, I’m Doston Sulaymon 👋

I’m a **Junior Backend Developer** from **Uzbekistan**, specializing in **Java** and **Spring-based technologies** (including **Spring Boot**, **Spring Security**, and more). I’m passionate about **web development**, particularly focusing on backend solutions and scalable systems.

🚀 I’ve worked on projects like a **YouTube Clone**, where I gained hands-on experience with **Spring Security**, **Docker**, **Swagger**, **logging**, and more, expanding my skill set in modern backend development.

🎓 I’m **self-taught** and continuously stay updated with new technologies through reading articles and LinkedIn tutorials.

🌱 My goal is to work with a **FAANG company** or start my own venture. I’m deeply interested in **backend development** and exploring **mobile development**.

💡 In my free time, I enjoy **reading**, playing **ping pong**, and I’m a huge fan of **strategy games** like *Generals*.

Let’s connect and collaborate! 🤝
